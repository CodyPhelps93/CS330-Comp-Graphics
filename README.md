1.	How do I approach designing software?
*	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? <br>
I learned that I need to draw things out more. When I actually drew out the vertices and mapped them out on paper it made plotting them in the code just that much easier.
*	What design process did you follow for your project work? <br>
The process I followed was pretty much planning each week. I would start out by looking at what was needing to be done that week and then drawing it out on paper and making pseudocode to implement it. 
*	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? <br>
The tactics I used as far as using encapsulation, and just trying to be neat with my code will make it to where my programs are much more readable and easier to debug. 
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
*	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? <br>
Starting small and building up. By creating a working program and slowly adding to it made the process easier. 
*	How did iteration factor into your development? <br>
Going week to week and doing the milestones allowed me time to think and to trouble shoot the problems that I was having on that particular implementation for that week.
*	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? <br>
Research is vital. I spent more time researching different techniques for implementing the milestone and how I could incorporate it into my code. When I first started I just tried to wing it and go straight from the tutorial. This actually hindered my development and made understanding harder. 
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? <br>
*	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? <br>
It allowed me to see how vital researching different ways of coding and planning can help solve and issue. Just by drawing things out on paper and physically drawing out my world helped to layout where the objects needed to go. I also see the value of separating code and not just having 1 file where everything is coded at.
*	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? <br>
I will plan my projects out better while also doing more research into different implementation strategies. Up until now I could just rely on going straight to coding but this project has shown me just how important the planning stage is.
